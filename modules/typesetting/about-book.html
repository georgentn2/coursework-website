        <h1>About Alchemist</h1>
        <cite>-Paulo Coelho</cite>

        <p>
          Paulo Coelho's enchanting novel has inspired a devoted following
          around the world. This story, dazzling in its powerful simplicity and
          soul-stirring wisdom, is about an Andalusian shepherd boy named
          Santiago, who travels from his homeland in Spain to the Egyptian
          desert in search of a treasure buried near the Pyramids.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          &quot; When you really want something, the universe always conspires in your
          favour. &quot;
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Along the way he meets a Romany woman, a man who calls himself a king,
          and an alchemist, all of whom point Santiago in the right direction
          for his quest. No one knows what the treasure is, or whether Santiago
          will be able to surmount the obstacles in his path; but what starts
          out as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a discovery of
          treasure within. Lush, evocative, and deeply humane, the story of
          Santiago is an eternal testament to the transforming power of our
          dreams and the importance of listening to our hearts.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          &quot; The story has the comic charm, dramatic tension, and psychological
          intensity of a fairy tale, but it’s full of specific wisdom as well. A
          sweetly exotic tale for young and old alike. &quot; —Publishers Weekly
