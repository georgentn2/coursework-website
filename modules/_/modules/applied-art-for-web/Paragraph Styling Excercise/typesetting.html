		<h1>The Little Prince</h1>
		<cite>written and illustrated by Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry</cite>
		<h2>A dedication to a friend</h2>
		<h3>from Chapter 4</h3>
		<blockquote>When you really want something, the universe always conspires in your favour.</blockquote>
		<p>I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairytales. I should have like to say: "Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than himself, and who had need of a sheep..."</p>

		<p>To those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story. For I do not want anyone to read my book carelessly. I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories. Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his sheep. If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him.</p>
		<blockquote>To forget a friend is sad. Not everyone has had a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures...</blockquote>
