By ten o\'clock the police organisation, and by midday even the railway organisations, were losing coherency, losing shape and efficiency, guttering, softening, running at last in that swift liquefaction of the social body.</p>\r\n<p>All the railway lines north of the Thames and the South-Eastern people at Cannon Street had been warned by midnight on Sunday, and trains were being filled. People were fighting savagely for standing-room in the carriages even at two o\'clock. By three, people were being trampled and crushed even in Bishopsgate Street, a couple of hundred yards or more from Liverpool Street station; revolvers were fired, people stabbed, and the policemen who had been sent to direct the traffic, exhausted and infuriated, were breaking the heads of the people they were called out to protect.</p>\r\n<p>And as the day advanced and the engine drivers and stokers refused to return to London, the pressure of the flight drove the people in an ever-thickening multitude away from the stations and along the northward-running roads. By midday a Martian had been seen at Barnes, and a cloud of slowly sinking black vapour drove along the Thames and across the flats of Lambeth, cutting off all escape over the bridges in its sluggish advance. Another bank drove over Ealing, and surrounded a little island of survivors on Castle Hill, alive, but unable to escape.</p>', 'H. G. Wells', 'The War of the Worlds', '2022-02-15 12:18:07'),
(2, 'The scene in Central London', '<p><img src=\"images/wells.jpg\" alt=\"W. G. Wells\">Going on along the Strand to Trafalgar Square, the paper in his hand, my brother saw some of the fugitives from West Surrey.  There was a man with his wife and two boys and some articles of furniture in a cart such as greengrocers use.  He was driving from the direction of Westminster Bridge; and close behind him came a hay waggon with five or six respectable-looking people in it, and some boxes and bundles. The faces of these people were haggard, and their entire appearance contrasted conspicuously with the Sabbath-best appearance of the people on the omnibuses.  People in fashionable clothing peeped at them out of cabs.  They stopped at the Square as if undecided which way to take, and finally turned eastward along the Strand.  Some way behind these came a man in workday clothes, riding one of those old-fashioned tricycles with a small front wheel.  He was dirty and white in the face.</p>', '<p><img src=\"images/wells.jpg\" alt=\"W. G.

He noticed an unusual number of police regulating the traffic.  Some of the refugees were exchanging news with the people on the omnibuses. One was professing to have seen the Martians. &ldquo;Boilers on stilts, I tell you, striding along like men.&rdquo;  Most of them were excited and animated by their strange experience.</p>\r\n<p>Beyond Victoria the public-houses were doing a lively trade with these arrivals.  At all the street corners groups of people were reading papers, talking excitedly, or staring at these unusual Sunday visitors.  They seemed to increase as night drew on, until at last the roads, my brother said, were like Epsom High Street on a Derby Day.  My brother addressed several of these fugitives and got unsatisfactory answers from most.</p>\r\n<p>None of them could tell him any news of Woking except one man, who assured him that Woking had been entirely destroyed on the previous night.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I come from Byfleet,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;man on a bicycle came through the place in the early morning, and ran from door to door warning us to come away.  Then came soldiers.  We went out to look, and there were clouds of smoke to the south&mdash;nothing but smoke, and not a soul coming that way.  Then we heard the guns at Chertsey, and folks coming from Weybridge.  So I\'ve locked up my house and come on.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>At the time there was a strong feeling in the streets that the authorities were to blame for their incapacity to dispose of the invaders without all this inconvenience.</p>', 'H.

(3, 'I am in the habit of going to sea', '<p>Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries&mdash;stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.</p>', '<p>Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries&mdash;stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images/ship.jpg\" alt=\"sailing ship\">But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd\'s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd\'s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies&mdash;what is the one charm wanting?&mdash;Water&mdash;there is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.</p>\r\n<p>Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick&mdash;grow quarrelsome&mdash;don\'t sleep of nights&mdash;do not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing; &mdash; no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honourable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not. And as for going as cook, &mdash; though I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board&mdash;yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;&mdash;though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.</p>', 'Herman Melville', 'Moby Dick', '2022-02-17 12:29:25'),
(4, 'On his back was a quiverful of arrows', '<p>The way led along upon what had once been the embankment of a railroad.  But no train had run upon it for many years. The forest on either side  swelled up the slopes of the embankment and crested across it in a green  wave of trees and bushes.

Occasionally, a piece of rusty  iron, showing through the forest-mould, advertised that the rail and the  ties still remained. In one place, a ten-inch tree, bursting through at  a connection, had lifted the end of a rail clearly into view. The tie  had evidently followed the rail, held to it by the spike long enough  for its bed to be filled with gravel and rotten leaves, so that now the  crumbling, rotten timber thrust itself up at a curious slant.

They moved slowly, for  the old man was very old, a touch of palsy made his movements tremulous,  and he leaned heavily upon his staff. A rude skull-cap of goat-skin  protected his head from the sun. From beneath this fell a scant fringe  of stained and dirty-white hair. A visor, ingeniously made from a large  leaf, shielded his eyes, and from under this he peered at the way of  his feet on the trail. His beard, which should have been snow-white  but which showed the same weather-wear and camp-stain as his hair,  fell nearly to his waist in a great tangled mass. About his chest and  shoulders hung a single, mangy garment of goat-skin. His arms and legs,  withered and skinny, betokened extreme age, as well as did their sunburn  and scars and scratches betoken long years of exposure to the elements.</p>\r\n<p>The boy, who led the way, checking the eagerness of his muscles to  the slow progress of the elder, likewise wore a single garment&mdash;a  ragged-edged piece of bear-skin, with a hole in the middle through which he had thrust his head. He could not have been more than twelve years old. Tucked coquettishly over one ear was the freshly severed tail of a  pig. In one hand he carried a medium-sized bow and an arrow.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images/bear.jpg\" alt=\"grizzly bear\">On his back was a quiverful of arrows. From a sheath hanging about his  neck on a thong, projected the battered handle of a hunting knife. He  was as brown as a berry, and walked softly, with almost a catlike tread.  In marked contrast with his sunburned skin were his eyes&mdash;blue, deep  blue, but keen and sharp as a pair of gimlets. They seemed to bore into aft about him in a way that was habitual. As he went along he smelled  things, as well, his distended, quivering nostrils carrying to his brain an endless series of messages from the outside world. Also, his hearing  was acute, and had been so trained that it operated automatically.  Without conscious effort, he heard all the slight sounds in the apparent  quiet&mdash;heard, and differentiated, and classified these sounds&mdash;whether  they were of the wind rustling the leaves, of the humming of bees and  gnats, of the distant rumble of the sea that drifted to him only in  lulls, or of the gopher, just under his foot, shoving a pouchful of  earth into the entrance of his hole.</p>\r\n<p>Suddenly he became alertly tense. Sound, sight, and odor had given him  a simultaneous warning. His hand went back to the old man, touching  him, and the pair stood still. Ahead, at one side of the top of the  embankment, arose a crackling sound, and the boy\'s gaze was fixed on the  tops of the agitated bushes. Then a large bear, a grizzly, crashed into  view, and likewise stopped abruptly, at sight of the humans. He did not  like them, and growled querulously. Slowly the boy fitted the arrow to  the bow, and slowly he pulled the bowstring taut. But he never removed  his eyes from the bear.</p>', 'Jack London', 'The Scarlet Plague', '2022-02-18 12:35:25'),

Each ball-like house was surmounted by some manner of carven image, which Ja told me indicated the identity of the owner.</p>\r\n<p>Horizontal slits, six inches high and two or three feet wide, served to admit light and ventilation.  The entrances to the house were through small apertures in the bases of the trees and thence upward by rude ladders through the hollow trunks to the rooms above.  The houses varied in size from two to several rooms.  The largest that I entered was divided into two floors and eight apartments.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images/village.jpg\" alt=\"jungle village\">All about the village, between it and the jungle, lay beautifully cultivated fields in which the Mezops raised such cereals, fruits, and vegetables as they required.  Women and children were working in these gardens as we crossed toward the village.  At sight of Ja they saluted deferentially, but to me they paid not the slightest attention.  Among them and about the outer verge of the cultivated area were many warriors.  These too saluted Ja, by touching the points of their spears to the ground directly before them.</p>\r\n<p>Ja conducted me to a large house in the center of the village&mdash;the house with eight rooms&mdash;and taking me up into it gave me food and drink.  There I met his mate, a comely girl with a nursing baby in her arms.  Ja told her of how I had saved his life, and she was thereafter most kind and hospitable toward me, even permitting me to hold and amuse the tiny bundle of humanity whom Ja told me would one day rule the tribe, for Ja, it seemed, was the chief of the community.</p>\r\n<p>We had eaten and rested, and I had slept, much to Ja\'s amusement, for it seemed that he seldom if ever did so, and then the red man proposed that I accompany him to the temple of the Mahars which lay not far from his village.  &ldquo;We are not supposed to visit it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but the great ones cannot hear and if we keep well out of sight they need never know that we have been there.  For my part I hate them and always have, but the other chieftains of the island think it best that we continue to maintain the amicable relations which exist between the two races; otherwise I should like nothing better than to lead my warriors amongst the hideous creatures and exterminate them&mdash;Pellucidar would be a better place to live were there none of them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I wholly concurred in Ja\'s belief, but it seemed that it might be a difficult matter to exterminate the dominant race of Pellucidar.  Thus conversing we followed the intricate trail toward the temple, which we came upon in a small clearing surrounded by enormous trees similar to those which must have flourished upon the outer crust during the carboniferous age.</p>', 'Edgar Rice Burroughs', 'At the Earth\'s Core', '2022-02-19 12:36:34'),

Upon a long table lay a victim even as I was ushered into the room.  Several Mahars stood about the poor creature holding him down so that he could not move.  Another, grasping a sharp knife with her three-toed fore foot, was laying open the victim\'s chest and abdomen.  No anesthetic had been administered and the shrieks and groans of the tortured man were terrible to hear. This, indeed, was vivisection with a vengeance.  Cold sweat broke out upon me as I realized that soon my turn would come.  And to think that where there was no such thing as time I might easily imagine that my suffering was enduring for months before death finally released me!</p>\r\n<p>The Mahars had paid not the slightest attention to me as I had been brought into the room.  So deeply immersed were they in their work that I am sure they did not even know that the Sagoths had entered with me. The door was close by.  Would that I could reach it!  But those heavy chains precluded any such possibility.  I looked about for some means of escape from my bonds.  Upon the floor between me and the Mahars lay a tiny surgical instrument which one of them must have dropped.  It looked not unlike a button-hook, but was much smaller, and its point was sharpened.  A hundred times in my boyhood days had I picked locks with a button-hook.  Could I but reach that little bit of polished steel I might yet effect at least a temporary escape.</p>\r\n<p>Crawling to the limit of my chain, I found that by reaching one hand as far out as I could my fingers still fell an inch short of the coveted instrument.  It was tantalizing!  Stretch every fiber of my being as I would, I could not quite make it.</p>\r\n<p>At last I turned about and extended one foot toward the object.  My heart came to my throat!  I could just touch the thing!  But suppose that in my effort to drag it toward me I should accidentally shove it still farther away and thus entirely out of reach!  Cold sweat broke out upon me from every pore.  Slowly and cautiously I made the effort. My toes dropped upon the cold metal.  Gradually I worked it toward me until I felt that it was within reach of my hand and a moment later I had turned about and the precious thing was in my grasp.</p>\r\n<p>Assiduously I fell to work upon the Mahar lock that held my chain.  It was pitifully simple.  A child might have picked it, and a moment later I was free.  The Mahars were now evidently completing their work at the table.  One already turned away and was examining other victims, evidently with the intention of selecting the next subject.</p>', 'Edgar Rice Burroughs', 'At the Earth\'s Core', '2022-02-20 12:45:34'),

There was something fungoid in the oily brown skin, something in the clumsy deliberation of the tedious movements unspeakably nasty.  Even at this first encounter, this first glimpse, I was overcome with disgust and dread.</p>\r\n<p>Suddenly the monster vanished.  It had toppled over the brim of the cylinder and fallen into the pit, with a thud like the fall of a great mass of leather.  I heard it give a peculiar thick cry, and forthwith another of these creatures appeared darkly in the deep shadow of the aperture.</p>\r\n<p>I turned and, running madly, made for the first group of trees, perhaps a hundred yards away; but I ran slantingly and stumbling, for I could not avert my face from these things.</p>\r\n<p>There, among some young pine trees and furze bushes, I stopped, panting, and waited further developments.  The common round the sand pits was dotted with people, standing like myself in a half-fascinated terror, staring at these creatures, or rather at the heaped gravel at the edge of the pit in which they lay.  And then, with a renewed horror, I saw a round, black object bobbing up and down on the edge of the pit.  It was the head of the shopman who had fallen in, but showing as a little black object against the hot western sun.  Now he got his shoulder and knee up, and again he seemed to slip back until only his head was visible.  Suddenly he vanished, and I could have fancied a faint shriek had reached me.  I had a momentary impulse to go back and help him that my fears overruled.</p>\r\n<p>Everything was then quite invisible, hidden by the deep pit and the heap of sand that the fall of the cylinder had made.  Anyone coming along the road from Chobham or Woking would have been amazed at the sight&mdash;a dwindling multitude of perhaps a hundred people or more standing in a great irregular circle, in ditches, behind bushes, behind gates and hedges, saying little to one another and that in short, excited shouts, and staring, staring hard at a few heaps of sand.  The barrow of ginger beer stood, a queer derelict, black against the burning sky, and in the sand pits was a row of deserted vehicles with their horses feeding out of nosebags or pawing the ground.</p>', 'H.

I find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states, Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my travels with Mina.</p>\r\n<p>In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities: Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the East and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (Mem., I must ask the Count all about them.)</p>\r\n<p>I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was still thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then. I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was &ldquo;mamaliga,&rdquo; and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a very excellent dish, which they call &ldquo;impletata.&rdquo; (Mem., get recipe for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the more unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images/castle.jpg\" alt=\"castle in Transylvania\">All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts of attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy about the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other, and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there were petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands.
