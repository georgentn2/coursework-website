                The horizon was tinged with red&#44; and suddenly the sun appeared. The boy thought back to that conversation with his father&#44; and felt happy; he had already seen many castles and met many women &#40; but none the equal of the one who awaited him
                several days hence ). He owned a jacket&#44; a book that he could trade for another&#44; and a flock of sheep. But&#44; most important&#44; he was able every day to live out his dream. If he were to tire of the Andalusian fields&#44; he
                could sell his sheep and go to sea. By the time he had had enough of the sea&#44; he would already have known other cities&#44; other women&#44; and other chances to be happy. I couldn&#39;t have found God in the seminary&#44; he thought&#44;
                as he looked at the sunrise. Whenever he could&#44; he sought out a new road to travel. He had never been to that ruined church before&#44; in spite of having traveled through those parts many times. The world was huge and inexhaustible;
                he had only to allow his sheep to set the route for a while&#44; and he would discover other interesting things. The problem is that they don&#39;t even realize that they&#39;re walking a new road every day. They don&#39;t see that the
                fields are new and the seasons change. All they think about is food and water.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe we&#39;re all that way&#44; the boy mused. Even me &#45; I haven&#39;t thought of other women since I met the merchant&#39;s daughter. Looking at the sun&#44; he calculated that he would reach Tarifa before midday. There&#44; he could exchange his
                book for a thicker one&#44; fill his wine bottle&#44; shave&#44; and have a haircut; he had to prepare himself for his meeting with the girl&#44; and he didn&#39;t want to think about the possibility that some other shepherd&#44; with
                a larger flock of sheep&#44; had arrived there before him and asked for her hand. It&#39;s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting&#44; he thought&#44; as he looked again at the position of the sun&#44;
                and hurried his pace. He had suddenly remembered that&#44; in Tarifa&#44; there was an old woman who interpreted dreams.
            </p>
            <p>
                The old woman led the boy to a room at the back of her house; it was separated from her living room by a curtain of colored beads. The room&#39;s furnishings consisted of a table&#44; an image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus&#44; and two chairs. The woman
                sat down&#44; and told him to be seated as well. Then she took both of his hands in hers&#44; and began quietly to pray.
            </p>
            <p>
                It sounded like a Gypsy prayer. The boy had already had experience on the road with Gypsies; they also traveled&#44; but they had no flocks of sheep. People said that Gypsies spent their lives tricking others. It was also said that they had a pact with
                the devil&#44; and that they kidnapped children and&#44; taking them away to their mysterious camps&#44; made them their slaves. As a child&#44; the boy had always been frightened to death that he would be captured by Gypsies&#44; and
                this childhood fear returned when the old woman took his hands in hers.
            </p>
            <p>
                But she has the Sacred Heart of Jesus there&#44; he thought&#44; trying to reassure himself. He didn&#39;t want his hand to begin trembling&#44; showing the old woman that he was fearful. He recited an Our Father silently.
