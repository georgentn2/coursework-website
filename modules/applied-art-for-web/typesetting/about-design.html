            <p>
                I am always interested in retro aesthetics and the old school model fonts, thats why when it comes to design a typographic related website, I decided to use some old schools serif fonts and designed something in a retro model.
            </p>

            <blockquote>&quot;old is gold &quot;</blockquote>

            <h2>Why this Book</h2>
            <p>
                I personaly like this book a lot like everyone. It is one of the few books which influenced me a lot. It focuses on the individual and the pursuit of individual dreams as a positive contribution to the “Soul of the World”. It shows that obstacles to one's
                personal problems are merely obstacles – not dead ends. It challenges you to think about your own personal powers. It explores the meaning of “living the dream” The constant theme in The Alchemist is to pursue your dreams by following
                what your heart desires. During the young boy's journey, he learns to listen to the heart and to follow the language of omens. The Alchemist has sold more than 65 million copies, making it one of the most popular books of all time.
            </p>
            <h2>Why these Fonts</h2>
            <p>
                In my perspective, the Retro model fonts are evergreen. It's hard to define what makes a serif typeface “retro.” It's as much about feel as anything else. The font in combination with other elements brings it all together. ... The minimal style has a
                defined throwback feel.
            </p>
            <h4>Old Standard TT</h4>
            <h5>
                I choose this typeface because it is the classicist style still can be considered a good choice for typesetting. its specific features are closely associated in the people’s eyes with old books we have learned on. So decided to use it for the page headings
            </h5>
            <h4>Merriweather</h4>
            <h5>
                I choose this typeface because it is one of my favorite serif fonts. Merriweather has a very geometric feel and is very readable at small sizes. It can even be used as a body typeface because of its natural letter width and weight. So decided to use it
                for blockquotes.
            </h5>
            <h4>Brawler</h4>
            <h5>
                I choose this typeface because it is a compact typeface with sharp features and a sturdy character, designed for comfortable reading in small sizes. Brawler is a classic example of fonts that maintain an old-school style that still pleases crowds today.
                With its sharp edges and sturdy feel, this is a Google font that can add elegance to any design.
            </h5>
            <h2>Why these Colors</h2>
            <p>
                I choose pale white shade as my background color because a white background provides maximal value contrast and, therefore, optimal readability for body text. Given a wooden brown shade as body color which enhances the white background color of the wrapper
                and makes the webpage a feeling of text document or a book. The dark blue shade gives good contrast and readability for the passage and it matches the overall visual aesthetics which this retro website demands. I took the coverpage of
                The Alchemist book as my design Inspiration which is closely related to the reddish brown and orange touch. I selected these colors because Ait gives a sense of strength and reliability. Brown is often seen as solid, much like the earth,
                and it's a color often associated with resilience, dependability, security, and safety which is properly matching with the theme of the content.
