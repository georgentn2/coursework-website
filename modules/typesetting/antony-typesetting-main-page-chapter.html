        <p>
          The horizon was tinged with red, and suddenly the sun appeared. The
          boy thought back to that conversation with his father, and felt happy;
          he had already seen many castles and met many women ( but none the
          equal of the one who awaited him several days hence ). He owned a
          jacket, a book that he could trade for another, and a flock of sheep.
          But, most important, he was able every day to live out his dream. If
          he were to tire of the Andalusian fields, he could sell his sheep and
          go to sea. By the time he had had enough of the sea, he would already
          have known other cities, other women, and other chances to be happy. I
          couldn't have found God in the seminary, he thought, as he looked at
          the sunrise. Whenever he could, he sought out a new road to travel. He
          had never been to that ruined church before, in spite of having
          traveled through those parts many times. The world was huge and
          inexhaustible; he had only to allow his sheep to set the route for a
          while, and he would discover other interesting things. The problem is
          that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every
          day. They don't see that the fields are new and the seasons change.
          All they think about is food and water.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe we're all that way, the boy mused. Even meâ€”I haven't thought of
          other women since I met the merchant's daughter. Looking at the sun,
          he calculated that he would reach Tarifa before midday. There, he
          could exchange his book for a thicker one, fill his wine bottle,
          shave, and have a haircut; he had to prepare himself for his meeting
          with the girl, and he didn't want to think about the possibility that
          some other shepherd, with a larger flock of sheep, had arrived there
          before him and asked for her hand. It's the possibility of having a
          dream come true that makes life interesting, he thought, as he looked
          again at the position of the sun, and hurried his pace. He had
          suddenly remembered that, in Tarifa, there was an old woman who
          interpreted dreams.
        </p>

        <p>
          The old woman led the boy to a room at the back of her house; it was
          separated from her living room by a curtain of colored beads. The
          room's furnishings consisted of a table, an image of the Sacred Heart
          of Jesus, and two chairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman sat down, and told him to be seated as well. Then she took
          both of his hands in hers, and began quietly to pray.
        </p>
        <p>
          It sounded like a Gypsy prayer. The boy had already had experience on
          the road with Gypsies; they also traveled, but they had no flocks of
          sheep. People said that Gypsies spent their lives tricking others. It
          was also said that they had a pact with the devil, and that they
          kidnapped children and, taking them away to their mysterious camps,
          made them their slaves. As a child, the boy had always been frightened
          to death that he would be captured by Gypsies, and this childhood fear
          returned when the old woman took his hands in hers.
        </p>
        <p>
          But she has the Sacred Heart of Jesus there, he thought, trying to
          reassure himself. He didn't want his hand to begin trembling, showing
          the old woman that he was fearful. He recited an Our Father silently.
